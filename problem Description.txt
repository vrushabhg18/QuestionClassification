PFA of the NLP Task with the following guidelines:

1. Use a learning based approach for solving the task
2. Share the git link along with dependencies and how to run the code

Identify Question Type: Given a question, the aim is to identify the category it belongs to.
The four categories to handle for this assignmentare : Who, What, When, Affirmation(yes/no).
Label any sentence that does not fall in any of the above four as "Unknown" type.
You should come up with data structures to encapsulate these information as well as the code that populates the relevant data.
You can use any machine learning technique and use the attached labelled data set for learning. 
The output should be driven keeping in mind the reply to the question.

Example:
1. What is your name? Type: What
2. When is the show happening? Type: When
3. Is there a cab available for airport? Type: Affirmation
There are ambiguous cases to handle as well like:
What time does the train leave(this looks like a what question but is actually a When type)

For testing, you can also look for datasets on the net. Sample (though the categories are different here):
